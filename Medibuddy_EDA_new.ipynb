        "This project focuses on solving key business challenges for MediBuddy by using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to convert raw insurance and customer data into actionable insights. The primary problem was a lack of clarity on customer behavior, revenue contribution, and factors influencing growth and churn.\n",

        "Through systematic data cleaning, merging, and visualization, the analysis identified patterns in customer demographics, policy usage, and revenue distribution. Key segments contributing most to business value were highlighted, while low-engagement or low-revenue segments were identified as potential risk areas. The analysis also uncovered inefficiencies such as underperforming customer groups and uneven contribution across plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "By addressing these problems, the project provides data-driven recommendations to improve customer targeting, optimize pricing and product offerings, and enhance retention strategies. Overall, the analysis helps MediBuddy move from intuition-based decisions to insight-driven actions that support sustainable business growth."
